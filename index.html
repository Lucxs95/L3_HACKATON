    •Travelers with disabilities have difficulties finding hotels that are accessible. For
    example, a person in a wheelchair will find a room that does not offer a compliant
    bathroom, or the buffet service does not offer a tray holder. A blind person may find
    himself in a room where the room-service is not trained and will systematically have
    difficulties to find his things.
    
    •To overcome this problem, there are more or less reliable sources of information on
    the accessibility of hotels. These sources are based on the declaration of the
    establishments themselves or on authentication organizations such as the state mark
    "Tourisme Et Handicap". The limit of the second method is its scalability, while the first
    method can be criticized for its lack of rigor.
    
    ### Can you propose a method to identify and locate, with a certain probability, accessible hotels?
    
    
    • Learn (deep) from a list of hotels already identified as accessible and propose new ones by
    applying the same identification criteria.
    
    • Propose a way to facilitate scalability.
    
    • The expected result would be a model AND a software application.
